# ECEN 5623 Real-Time-Embedded-Systems

This repository contains code developed for Real Time Embedded Systems course at University of Colorado Boulder.

## Development Platform

Raspberry Pi 3b+/4 and a Logitech UVC compatible USB camera

## Topics covered:

- Real-time analysis, design and development theory and practices as well as fundamentals of integrating microprocessor-based embedded system hardware, firmware and software to meet well-specified system requirements for operation within real-time constraints. 
- Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA) 
- logging, profiling and tracing 
- mission critical feature design
- fault-tolerant memory and storage
- multi-core processing
- asymmetric multi-processing methods for real-time design compared to RTOS and cyclic executive architectures.
